          <h2>Hello!</h2>
          <p>My name is Wedney, I'm a Biology student at the Federal University of Goias in Brazil and I love red. On another note, my love for animals (spiders in particular) has been with me since my early years, as has my love for games and tech. Despite being in the pursuit of a Biological Sciences degree, I would love to work in the tech industry as a programmer.</p>

            <h3>Coding</h3>
            <p>I started to learn code on-and-off since my early teens. Recently I have bought specific courses on the subject and studied through these. Mostly on Web and Android Development</p>

            <h3>Digital Art</h3>
            <p>I also started with art from an early age, but it was all just fun and games for the majority of the time. Recently, I got a graphics tablet as a present and have been venturing in the digital arts.</p>

            <h3>Hardware</h3>
            <p>I've been into PC hardware and troubleshooting since I got my first computer, nowadays I've accumulated a lot of general knowledge on PC Hardware. I've built dozens of computers to date including my own.</p>

            <h3>Languages</h3>
            <p>Despite being Brazilian, I've been fluent in English since I was 8 years old because I studied in the United Kingdom. As of my early teens I've been studying Japanese on and off and today I can read and write some things in hiragana, despite having a good pronunciation (according to native speaking friends), I still need to broaden my vocabulary (and learn Kanji).</p>
